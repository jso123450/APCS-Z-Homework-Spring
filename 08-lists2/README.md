Not completely sure why the results are what they are...

<br>

The ArrayList sum is always very fast.

<br>

The LList sum uses a loop within a loop (the loop used in LLsum() from TimeTest.java uses get(int i) from LList.java, which also uses a loop)

<br>

The LinkedList sum should also be using a similar method; perhaps there was a more efficient way to reduce runtime speed than what I have here.
